# Layers

Create directories for each layer in the `src/MeetupOrganizing` directory:

- Domain
- Application
- Infrastructure

Now move all the code and resources in `src/` to the appropriate "layer".

## Bonus

Consider wrapping `app/container.php` inside some class. Where would it belong in the new directory structure?
